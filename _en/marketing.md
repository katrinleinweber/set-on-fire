-   It's tempting to think of science as purely meritocratic
    -   "If I do good science, it should speak for itself"
    -   "Advertising is pretentious and self-serving"
-   In reality, scientists are social creatures
    -   We all have our own social networks of trust
    -   Technology has helped with discoverability of new research
    -   Still not as effective as getting airtime from a high-profile outlet
        -   Glamor journal (Nature, Science, etc.)
        -   Twitter account of a big shot in the field
-   Don't be afraid to [market your project][kuchner-marketing]
    -   If it really is good, you should tell people about it
-   The concert merchandise model
    -   Your grant proposals are your product
    -   Your papers are your advertisements
-   Consider the following:
    -   What part does software play in your research?
    -   Who procures funding for your research, and what are the expectations about software of those funding agencies?
    -   Are you funded/employed primarily to produce software tools? Or to produce theories/models/results/methods?
-   We should clarify what marketing means
    -   It is not being pushy
    -   It is not shameless self-promotion
- Marketing is the craft of:
    -   seeing things from other people's perspective,
    -   understanding their wants and needs,
    -   and finding ways to meet them
-   Which means:
    -   Connecting with others in a sincere way
    -   Ensuring our work is relevant to important people and their concerns
    -   Here, important people mean people that are in a position to make decisions about funding, hiring, tenure, etc.
-   Use social media and blogs
    -   Papers must be objective, social media posts don't
        -   You can talk about what excites you about the research
        -   You can be personal and set whatever tone you'd like
        -   You can go out on a limb and make guesses and claims that might not get past peer reviewers
            -   The most important question isn't necessarily whether you're right,
                but whether you can engage your colleagues and get them thinking critically about your work.
    -   Worst-case scenario: nobody will listen
    -   Best-case: the right people will notice, remember, and maybe even advertise your work
-   Make the main paper(s) you want people to cite obvious in the documentation
    and in a `CITATION` file alongside the `README`
    -   If there isn't a paper yet, get agreement on what's needed for a "code paper"
    -   Journals like [JOSS][joss] and [JORS][jors] have clear guidelines and checklists
    -   Keep planning for future papers and how people should be credited for their work
        so that the community remains engaged and committed

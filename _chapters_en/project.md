title: "Organize Deliberately"
objectives:
-    "Explain Noble's rules and emphasize the principle of organizing and naming files to reflect their content or purpose."
keypoints:
-    "Name each project component (code, data, metadata, etc.) according to its content or purpose."
-    "Group similar project files into dedicated directories."
-    "Take advantage of widely used project organization conventions unless there is a compelling reason not to."

-   Project organization is like a diet
    -   There is no such thing as "no diet": you're "dieting" whether it's intentional or not
    -	It's either a *good* diet or a *poor* diet
    -   Similarly, there is no such thing as "no project organization"
    -	Your project is either organized *well* or organized *poorly*
-   An example: [Noble's rules][noble-rules]
    -   Code in `src/`
    -	Raw data in `data/`
    -	Programs in `bin/`
    -	Documentation and/or manuscripts in `doc/`
    -	Etc.
-   This isn't the only way to organize research software projects. What principles can we generalize?
    -   Name files according to their content or purpose.
    -   Group similar files together in appropriately named directories.
    -   Take advantage of naming and organization conventions unless there is a compelling reason to "roll your own".

## Exercises {#s:project-exercises}

Draw a diagram of how your project is currently organized.
-	Is this documented anywhere?
- 	Would it be intuitive for a newcomer?
- 	Are there any changes you could make to take advantage of common conventions?

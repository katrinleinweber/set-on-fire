title: "Research Software Engineers"
questions:
-   "What is a research software engineer?"
-   "Am I a research software engineer?"
objectives:
-   "Explain what research software engineers do and don't do."
keypoints:
-   "Research software engineers usually have advanced degrees in a research area, but are no longer principally doing research."
-   "Research software engineers design, write, test, and maintain software."
-   "Research software engineers need to understand languages, version control, build and test tools, performance tools, packaging, and lifecycle management."

-   [What is a research software engineer][what-is-rse] ([RSE](#g:rse))?
    -   Combine expertise in programming with an in-depth understanding of research
    -   Typically have:
        -   An advanced degree in a research discipline
        -   Lots of experience developing software (often acquired while working on their thesis)...
        -   ...but little or no formal training in software engineering
    -   "The astronomers who build telescopes so that others can study stars"
-   What *isn't* an RSE?
    -   Sys admin (although many RSEs wind up doing a lot of system administration)
    -   Lab tech (although sometimes classified as such for want of a more accurate job category)
    -   Principal investigator (although RSEs occasionally become PIs on infrastructure projects)
-   What do RSEs do?
    -   Design, write, test, and maintain software
    -   Manage data (or build tools to fetch, filter, organize, and process data)
    -   Deploy and run software (overlaps with sys admins)
    -   Software lifecycle management ([s:compromise](#CHAPTER))
        -   Often de facto process owners
    -   Training and mentoring ([s:mentor](#CHAPTER)
-   What do RSEs need to know?
    -   Programming language(s) - in more depth than most of their research colleagues
    -   Version control - ditto
    -   Build and test tools - often the only one on their team doing any of this
    -   Performance analysis and tuning - ditto
    -   Packaging and deployment - ditto

## Exercises {#s:rse-exercises}

### Are You an RSE?

Score yourself using the questions below.

1.  Are you employed to develop software for research?
1.  Are you spending more time developing software than conducting research?
1.  Are you employed as a postdoctoral researcher,
    even though you predominantly work on software development?
1.  Are you the person who does computers in your research group?
  Are you sometimes not named on research papers
    despite playing a fundamental part in developing the software used to create them?
1.  Do you lack the metrics needed to progress your academic career,
    like papers and conference presentations,
    despite having made a significant contribution through software?

### What Skills Do You Already Have?

What do you use for each of the following?
("Nothing yet" is a perfectly good answer.)
What fraction of what you think you need to know do you believe you actually know?

-   Programming language(s)
-   Version control
-   Build tools
-   Testing tools
-   Performance analysis tools
-   Packaging and deployment tools
-   Software project management tools

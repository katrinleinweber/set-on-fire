This workshop will show participants how to turn an individual research software project into a research software commons,
i.e., how to go from "I can use it on my machine" to "we can use it wherever we want".
Please see <https://gvwilson.github.io/brsc/> for a rendered version of this material
or run `make` in this directory for a list of helpful commands.
Please also see <https://github.com/gvwilson/youbou> for notes on the template used for this site,
and <http://teachtogether.tech> for our instructional design methodology.

Topics covered include:

-   how to organize and manage the software, data, tests, documentation, and manuscripts that make up a project,
-   what a mature workflow for a small research software commons looks like and how to implement it, and
-   how to build a community around a piece of useful software.

Comments and improvements are very welcome;
you can send us either by [filing issues]({{site.repo}}issues)
or [submitting pull requests]({{site.repo}}pulls).
Please first see the design notes in [s:guide](#APPENDIX) for instructors' material.

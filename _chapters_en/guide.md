## General Notes

See [[Wils2018](#CITE)] for design ideas.

It's all right not to get through the whole lesson.
:   This lesson is designed for people who have never programmed before,
    but any given class may include people with a wide range of prior experience.
    We have therefore included enough material to fill a full day if need be,
    but expect that many offerings will only get as far as the introduction to Pandas.

Don't tell people to Google things.
:   One of the goals of this less is
    to help novices build a workable mental model of how programming works.
    Until they have that model,
    they will not know what to search for or how to recognize a helpful answer.
    Telling them to Google can also give the impression that we think their problem is trivial.
    (That said, if learners have done enough programming before to be past these issues,
    having them search for solutions online can help them solidify their understanding.)
    Also,
    if you find anything,
    other folks were confused enough to bother with a blog or Stack Overflow post,
    so it's probably not trivial.

## Versioning

- Before the workshop, make a copy of the [SNDS repository](https://github.com/standage/snds-demo)
  by cloning it to your local system and pushing it to a new empty repo on Github
  (something like https://github.com/YourUsername/snds-demo-yyyy-mm-dd).
  Make sure to collect Github usernames from all participants pre-workshop so you can give them write access to the repo.
- The first pull request will be simple to merge.
  This will give an opportunity for a brief demo of the code review functionality, comment on particular lines, comment threads, etc.
- The second pull request will likely have a merge conflict.
  This is now super simple to handle in Github's web interface, and can also be covered in a very brief demo.

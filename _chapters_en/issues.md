title: "Tracking Work"
objectives:
-   "Describe what sorts of things should be recorded in an issue-tracking system."
-   "Describe what goes into a well-written issue."
-   "Explain how issue-tracking systems can be used to implement workflows."
-   "Explain how issue-tracking systems can be used to focus attention where it's needed."
keypoints:
-   "An issue-tracking system is a shared to-do list for a project."
-   "Every issue has a few mandatory fields to help with searching, and free-form text for details."
-   "Every issue is in a particular state."
-   "A project can define a workflow by specifying who can change tickets' states when."
-   "Use tickets to prioritize work: what needs be done now, what can be deferred until later."

-   Issue-tracking tools are often called bug trackers
    -   Well-organized teams use them as a shared to-do list to manage everything
    -   Version control tells you where you've been; issue tracking tells us where you're going
-   Can be used to:
    -   Request, plan, and discuss new features
    -   Describe bugs, and solicit/collect bug reports from community
    -   Dump ideas for future reference
-   Every task is recorded as a separate ticket
    -   Unique ID
    -   One-line summary to aid browsing
    -   Status (sometimes organized by [stages of grief][twitter-grief])
    -   Owner (i.e., who's responsible)
    -   Full description that may include screenshots, error messages, etc.
    -   History: who created it when, how it has been modified
    -   Threaded discussion

Summary: Message file reader crashes on accented characters
Description:
1.  Create a text file called 'accent.msg' containing the message
    "PÃ¼mpernickel" (with an umlaut over the 'u').

2.  Run 'python mindcontrol.py --all --message accent.msg'

Program crashes with the message "No encoding for [] on line 1 of 'accent.msg'".
([] shows where a solid black box appears in the output instead of a printable
character.)

-   More sophisticated systems allow people to:
    -   Record dependencies between tickets
    -   Estimate how long work will take
    -   Record how long work actually took
-   Can be used to make the development lifecycle explicit
    -   I.e., only allow certain state transitions
    -   And notify interested parties of state transitions

-   Don't worry about any of this until people are actually filing issues
-   Key utility: prioritization
    1.  What has to be done right now?
    2.  What should be done soon?
    3.  What can safely be left until later?
-   Criteria for decision:
    1.  How much do we need this?
    2.  How long will it take?
-   Key utility: documenting your team's work
    -   Whenever you start working on a new task/feature/bugfix, open a PR early in the process with a description of the in-progress work and links to any relevant tickets.
    -   Make it clear if and when the PR is ready for intermediate or final review.
        Use of status tags (such as **In Progress** and **Ready for Review**) is encouraged.
    -   Think of the issue tracker as a shared lab notebook.
        It contains a full record of work done, along with relevant discussion.
    -   Everyone can see what everyone else is up to.

## Exercises {#s:issues-lifecycle}

### What's On Your List?

1.  What are the top 3 items on your project's to-do list?
2.  How sure are you that your collaborators and users would agree with your selection?

### What's Your Lifecycle?

1.  What states can your project's issues be in?
2.  What state transitions are allowed?  ("Any to any" is a common and acceptable answer.)
3.  Who decides when an issue can move from one state to another?

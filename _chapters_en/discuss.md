## When *Not* to Use Version Control

*   You may need to meet people halfway if you want your project to grow
*   In particular, your collaborators might not be using version control
    *   And they might be right
*   Dropbox for files
    *   [Integrates with Git][git-dropbox]
    *   Non-trivial setup...
*   Similarly, they may not use LaTeX or Markdown for papers,
    and may be right there as well
    *   Google Docs for papers

title: "Continuous Integration"
objectives:
-   "Explain how continuous integration works."
-   "Configure continuous integration for a small software project."
keypoints:
-   "Continuous integration rebuilds and/or re-tests software every time something changes."
-   "Use continuous integration to check changes before they are inspected."
-   "Check style as well as correctness."
-   "Adopt a widely-used pre-defined coding style rather than inventing one of your own."

-   *Continuous integration*:
    -   Build and test code every time someone commits code
    -   Post results somewhere the team can see them
    -   If build or tests fail, send out notifications
-   Even better: build and test changes *before* they're merged
    -   Only do code review on changes that have passed mechanical checks
-   Keep track of test coverage
    -   Which parts of the code are being exercised and which aren't
    -   Many different ways to measure
    -   Most important measurement is "are we holding steady?"
-   Most widely used system is [Travis CI][travis-ci]
    -   Easy integration with [Github][github]
    -   Will run tests on multiple platforms and with multiple versions of tools
-   Developers still have to build the tests
    -   CI only as good as the tests it runs
-   Check style as well as correctness
    -   Sometimes called "linters" after the original [lint][lint] for C
    -   Equivalents have been built for most languages
        -   [pep8][pep8] for Python
        -   [formatR][formatR] for R
    -   Most are configurable
        -   Stick to a pre-defined style rather than argue about one of your own
    -   Automatic enforcement eliminates subjective arguments
        -   If the linter passes, the code is approved
        -   Guarantees you never have to worry about style if the linter is happy
        -   Most linters support exceptions, these can be approved in code review on a case-by-case basis

## Exercises {#s:continuous-exercises}

### Lint Your Code

1.  Find and install a [lint][lint]-like tool for your preferred language and run it on your code.
2.  What does it complain about?
3.  Which of its complaints do you disagree with?

### Setting Up Continuous Integration

Follow the steps in [this tutorial][python-travis-tutorial] to set up Travis-CI testing for the SNDS repository.
How long did it take you to set this up?

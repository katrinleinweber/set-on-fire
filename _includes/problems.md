Non-Decreasing Sub-Lists
:   Given a list of numbers,
    return a list of the sums of each non-decreasing sub-list.
    For example,
    if the input is `[1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 5, 6, 3, 1, 2, 3]`,
    the output should be `[9, 12, 3, 6]`.

Rectangle Overlay
:   Given two rectangles,
    each defined by the four values [x0, y0, x1, y1],
    return the rectangle representing their overlap.
    Assume all coordinates are integer.
    For example,
    if the inputs are `[0, 0, 2, 2]` and `[1, 1, 5, 3]`,
    the output should be `[1, 1, 2, 2]`.
